        <h4> Brief explanations about what we offer</h4>

        <p class="briefs">

        degrees in various academic disciplines. Universities typically provide undergraduate education and postgraduate
        education.

        </p>

        <p class="briefs">

        <h5>Bursary:</h5> is a monetary award made by an institution to individuals or groups of people who cannot
        afford to pay full fees.
        In return for the bursary the individual is usually obligated to be employed at the institution for the duration
        as the bursary.
        A bursary is usually for helping out the impoverished but deserving and those fallen on hard times.

        </p>

        <p class="briefs">

        <h5>Education loan:</h5> Financial institutions will lend you the money to pay for your studies – you will then
        be required to service the interest while you are studying, and pay back the capital once you have graduated.

        A student loan is paid directly to the financial institution where you are undertaking your studies (they will
        require proof that you have been accepted and registered to study).

        If you are studying full-time (thus not employed), someone will be required to stand surety for you and service
        the interest on your loan while you study – usually a parent or guardian.
