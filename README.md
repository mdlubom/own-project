I used MAMP which stands for (Macintosh, Apache, MySQL, and PHP). MAMP is an application you can install on your Mac which allows you to have access to a local PHP server and MySQL server. 

### What is this repository for? ###

This is an educational website. It's specifically for  South African university's information and financial assistance. 
The landing page explains what the website is about and how to navigate it. The is a page for almost all universities here in South Africa. The website doesn't only give important information, there are links to the  university's official websites so that if one wants, they could follow the link and apply.

It does not only give you information about the university , you can select universities according to a province, eg. if you select the Western Cape then all the universities in the province will be displayed and you can go to the specific one you want information about.

For financial assistance there is a Bursary page and Student Loans page. The Bursary page is categorised according to tertiary courses eg. there is an option for Education bursaries. The Student Loans page is categorised by some of the banks that offer Student Loans and NSFAS. 

And there is a contact page whereby the user can send me comments about the website or the information that's on it.
