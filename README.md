I used MAMP which stands for (Macintosh, Apache, MySQL, and PHP). MAMP is an application you can install on your Mac which allows you to have access to a local PHP server and MySQL server. Windows users can install WAMP which basically is the same application but for windows users.

### What is this repository for? ###

This is an educational website that provides and gives access to tertiary education options. It's specifically for  South African university's information and financial assistance. 

The landing page explains what the website is about and how to navigate it. There is a page for almost all universities here in South Africa. The website doesn't only give important information, but also links the users to selected university's official websites so that if one wants, they could apply to that certain university just by following the link.

It does not only give you information about the university , you can select universities according to a province, eg. if you select the Western Cape then all the universities in the province will be displayed and you can go to the specific one you want information about.

For financial assistance there is a Bursary page and Student Loans page. The Bursary page is categorised according to tertiary courses eg. there is an option for Education bursaries. The Student Loans page is categorised by some of the banks that offer Student Loans and NSFAS. 

There is a contact page whereby the user can send me comments about the website or even to make suggestions.
